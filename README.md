Continuous Integration - the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.

A Pipeline is composed of:
1. Tasks - script or scripts that defines how your build, test, and deployment steps are run.
2. Code - source code stored in a repository
3. Agent - an installable software that runs the build and deployment.
4. Artifact - smallest compiled unit that can be tested or deployed.

Concurrent Pipelines (aka Parallel Jobs) - Lets you run a single build or release job at any give time. Purchased at the organization level. Shared by all projects in the organization.
