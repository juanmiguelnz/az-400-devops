# Azure Application Insights

## Application Map
  - Helps you spot performance bottenecks or failure hotspots across all components of your distributed application. Each node on the map represents an application component or its dependencies, as well as health KPI and alert status.


## Smart Detection
  - Automatically warns you of potential performance problems in your web application. It performs proactive analysis of the telemetry that your app sends to Application Insights. If there is a sudden rise in failure rates, or abnormal patterns in client or server performance, you get an alert.


## Availability
  - Application insights sends web requests to your application at regular intervals from points around the world. It alerts you if your application doesn't respond or responds quickly.

## Failures
  - Aggregates all exception reports into a single dashboard. From here you can easily zero in on dependencies, exceptions, and other filters.

## Performance
  - Provides a dashboard that simplifies the details of application performance based on the collected telemetry.

## Users
  - Displays details about your users' geographies, operating systems, and browsers. Display also specific users to get a better understanding of their usage.

## Funnels
  - If you application involves multiple stages, you need to know if most customers are progressing through the entire process, or if they're ending the process at some point. The progression through a series of steps in a web application is known as a funnel. You can use Application Insights Funnels to gain insights into your users, and monitor step-by-step conversion rates.

## User Flows
  - Visualises how users navigate between the pages and features of your site. It's great for answering questions like:
      * How do users navigate away from a page on your site?
      * What do users click on a page on your site?
      * Where are the places that users churn most from your site?
      * Are there places where users repeat the same action over and over?
